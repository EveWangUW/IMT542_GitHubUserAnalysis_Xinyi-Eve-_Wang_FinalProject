# 3. How you decided to improve the structure
Therefore, according to the deficiencies identified based on the FAIR principle and the three axes of data portability in the existing information structure, I decided to improve the information accordingly so that it can better conform to FAIR and enhance its portability to eventually achieve the ideal use case for the recruiters. 

## FAIR Principles
In terms of the FAIR principles, 
To improve accessibility (A), 
1. implement a backup system to retain metadata even if the user account or repo is deleted, which can be accomplished by allowing the user to download the data from the web application.
To improve reusability (R),
1. Remove unnecessary attributes like avator_url and focus on displaying information related to recruiters.
2. Add relevant license for this application.
3. Add more analytics details and provenance information to provide recruiters with useful insights into candidate profiles.

## Data Portability
In terms of data portability,
1. Clean meaning

We need to provide a summary for each user and all repositories, highlight key information such as most frequently used programming language, account active level, average star per repository, etc, to help the recruiter to understand the hidden insights behind each data fields in the original information structure.

2. Accessibility

We should develop an accessible frontend web page where recruiters can search the GitHub user and easily view the comprehensive analysis of their account by clicking on a search button, saving the effort of manually making API calls to the endpoint. We will also provide downloadable data so that recruiters can archive past GitHub user performance and further analyze data if needed.

3. Transparency

We can provide detailed documentation on what each metadata represents, how they are used during data analysis, and what each of the generated data metrics means.

4. Usability

We can use the raw metadata and conduct a comprehensive analysis to generate deeper insights on the users, such as their most commonly used programming language, ultimately creating a summary of the user and their repos, helping recruiters quickly and systematically retrieve useful insights from the raw data.

5. Interoperability
- We will use Typescript as our main programming language, which will require detailed data type and data schema documentation for each attribute in the JSON data. This will be helpful when the data are used in other systems. 
- In addition, our application will use the React framework, which helps the webpage to be interoperable both on websites and on mobile devices. 
- Moreover, in the future, we will also consider converting the data to other formats such as CSV and XML formats to help improve interoperability.

6. Structure

We can combine the user and repository information into a single information structure that includes two nests about user info and repo info analysis, helping us to have more structured access to the analysis insights.
