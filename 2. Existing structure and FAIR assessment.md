# 2. Existing structure and FAIR assessment
## Define the existing information structure:
Through making API calls to two GitHub endpoints for user information (https://api.github.com/users/EveWangUW) and user repo information (https://api.github.com/users/EveWangUW/repos), using the GitHub account ‘EveWangUW’ as example, the existing information structure can be retrieved: (See the folder ‘existing_information_structure_example’ for the original user and user repo JSON files)

## How is the existing information structured:
The user information contains details such as 'login,' 'ID,' and 'followers', reflecting the general information about the user. However, this information structure also covers a lot of unnecessary information, such as 'avatar_url ','followers_url' and so on, that may make recruiters find it hard to understand the information, feel information overload, and reduce the speed of them finding good candidates, which is not conducive to them to realize their objectives. 

The user repo information contains details of each user's public repositories by presenting an array of different repositories. Although there are useful details in each repo, such as 'language,’ ‘created_at,' and 'updated_at,’ the user repo information also contains lots of information that is not useful for recruiters. Moreover, recruiters can only observe the candidate's 'performance' one repository at a time, which is not much different from observing the candidate's performance on the GitHub account page. Meanwhile, it also lacks a summary of the candidate's programming skills and deeper insights.

# What does the existing information structure look like?
See the existing information structures in the folder 'existing_information_structure_example' for the existing user and user repo information structures.

# Assess existing information structure:
## FAIR Principle
### What is the FAIR principle
The FAIR principle is a set of guidelines to improve the findability, acccessibility, interoprability, and reusability of digital assets such as data in research and beyond. 

### FAIR Assessment
#### GOOD
The existing information structure is well done in a number of ways. For example, in my existing information structure, both the user data and the user repo data have globally unique identifiers such as login and id (F1), and the metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe (F3), for example, the two data both include URLs to various resources such as ‘followers_url’ and ‘commits_url.’ There is also rich metadata on the user and repository details, such as update timestamps, profile URLs, and owner details (F2). The data are retrievable via standardized, open, and free APIs provided by GitHub (A1, A1.1). These data use the JSON language format, which is a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation (I1). Moreover, the various URLs included in the user and the repo data direct the users to related resources; for example, in the user data, there are URLs directing the users to the users' followers and following information (I3).

#### Deficiencies that need to be improved
However, if the user account or the repo is deleted, the metadata might not be accessible anymore, which may not conform to the A2 principle. In terms of reusability, although rich attributes are provided, some of the attributes are not very relevant to our recruiters, such as ‘avater_url’ and ‘is_template,’ not realizing R1. In user and user repo, most of the data lack license information, which does not conform to the R1.1. Finally, although time-related attributes such as ‘updated_at’ and ‘created_at’ provide some provenance information, more details could be included to achieve the R1.2 principle. 

## Data Portability
To achieve data portability, it is also important to make sure the information structure conform to the three axes of data portability. 

1. Clean meaning

First, the information structure should have a clean meaning; this means that the attributes and the value of the data should be clear, and the audience should be able to interpret the data easily. 

However, the current information doesn’t provide a very clear meaning for information users. Specifically, the current user and repo info only provide raw metadata without interpretation, and there is no summary of information, providing a vague meaning. Consequently, recruiters can only manually extract the information to analyze it and gain insights.

2. Accessibility

The information should be accessible, meaning that the users should have an easy way to access the information. 

However, the current data is only available through making manual GitHub API calls or directly accessing it by visiting the GitHub page of the candidate. Moreover, the recruiters need to repeat a lot of subjective interpretations to sift through the information and generate insights on the candidate, so the information is not very accessible.

3. Transparency

The information should also be transparent, meaning that the process of how the data is collected, processed, and presented should be provided to the audience, ensuring that they understand the source and the transformation of the data. 

However, the current information lacks transparency, as it is just information in the JSON format and does not explain how the GitHub user’s data was collected, processed, and presented; the recruiters may need to understand this information themselves, which may lead to some misunderstanding and difficulty in using the information.

4. Interoperability

It should also be interoperable, meaning that this information should be easy to use in different systems through methods such as providing other data formats of the same information, such as XML and CSV formats. 

However, the current information only has a simple JSON data format, and the user’s JSON file is separated from the repo’s JSON file, which lacks integration of information and also does not take into account the compatibility with other systems. Recruiters may need to take extra steps to convert the JSON format data into the format they want, which makes it more difficult to use the data.

5. Usability

It should also be usable, meaning that the information presented to the user should be immediately useful for the audience. 

However, the current data is only raw metadata of the GitHub user and lacks deeper insights into the user's programming skills. Therefore, the recruiter will have to spend a lot of time analyzing the data in order to assess the skills of the candidates, reducing the usability of the information.

6. Structure

Finally, the information should use an appropriate structure. 

However, the current structure is two scattered JSON files that do not combine user information and user repository information well enough to provide a more focused, summarizing structure for the user's programming skills. Therefore, the structure of our information should be improved as well.
