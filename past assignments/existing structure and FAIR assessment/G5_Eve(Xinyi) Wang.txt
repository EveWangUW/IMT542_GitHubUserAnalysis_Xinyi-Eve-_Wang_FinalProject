My project is about GitHub user profile analysis.To realize data portability, in terms of scope, user profiles are described with rich metadata such as the number of repositories, mostly frequently used language, and usernames are used as the identifier(primary key) of the data they describe ('F2' and 'F3').ÊFor format, authentication such as API key is required if you wish to obtain a user's private information such as commit history,conforming to the principle that authentication and authorisation are implemented where necessary ('A1.2').The response from the GitHub API endpoints are in JSON format, which is a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation ('I1'). For the scope and the format, the app will also choose MIT as its data liscense, showing that (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license, conforming to ÔR1.1Õ.In terms of access method, time stamps indicating when this repository was last updated and previous version of the repository are accessible in the web app, following the principle that Metadata should be accessible even when the data is no longer available ('A2').
