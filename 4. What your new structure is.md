# 4. What your new structure is

## What does the new structure look like?
- To see what the new structure looks like, go to folder 'new_information_structure_example'
- To generate a new information structure for your desired GitHub account, follow the instructions in the 'Readme.md' to access the application.

## New structure introduction:
This information will be presented through a web application. The recruiter can enter the GitHub user’s name in the frontend page powered by react and typescript.  The product will make an API call to the GitHub endpoints to retrieve the user’s account and repository information. 
On the one hand, the information will be displayed on the frontend in both the original JSON format and the manipulated new JSON format. There will also be download buttons for the recruiter to download the JSON file. 

In addition, after the JSON data is retrieved from the API, the product will filter the information and perform the relevant manipulation, such as calculating the time of the user on GitHub, the average star per repository, and the active level of the user on GitHub.

Eventually, this information is displayed on the front end and provides recruiters with relevant information about the candidate’s programming skills, helping recruiters evaluate and make the recruitment decision. 

## Information Itself: 
In terms of the information itself, compared to the existing information, the information has been trimmed down to keep it useful for recruiters to analyze candidate's programming skill level. In addition, new fields that are analyzed and summarized from the user and repo information, such as the time of the user on GitHub, are added to provide further insights.

## Structure and Format:
For the structure and format, the existing information structure uses raw JSON data directly retrieved from the GitHub API and includes overall too detailed fields that may not be relevant to the recruiters, such as node IDs or avatar URLs. As an improvement, the new structure uses filtered and summarized data that includes only relevant fields such as user name, repository name, and additional computed fields such as total time the user has been on GitHub and metrics about their programming skill levels, providing more relevant information to the recruiters. 

## Access Methodology:
In terms of access methodology, in the past, the recruiter could only learn about the user's information by directly accessing the target candidate's GitHub page. However, now, through the access technology of a REST API call, the recruiter is able to quickly get comprehensive information on the GitHub user and their repos. The user can also enter the username and download a quick summary of information from a GraphQL API endpoint, such as the name and email of the user and the description of their first 5 repositories.
