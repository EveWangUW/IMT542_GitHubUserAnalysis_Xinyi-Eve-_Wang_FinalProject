# 5. How would quality be identified and addressed
The desired performance of this information system is successfully realized. Specifically, this application can:
1. Extract user and repo data from GitHub API endpoints
2. Presenting both the original data and the newly manipulated data in JSON and text format on the web page
3. Provide download options for these data
4. Download a summary of user and repo data via a GraphQL query

There is little differences in quality compared to the original objective of this application. However, some possible risks that may cause differences in quality and a possible remediation plan is discussed as follows.

1. Functional Tests with unit-testing to handle errors:
First of all, the application may experience errors during the operation, resulting in the information not being properly acquired, processed, and presented.

Therefore, in order to ensure the project is durable and robust, we will add unit testing in the application, from the user interaction with the frontend to send requests and receive responses to manipulate data to the final frontend information presentation, ensuring a 99%+ test coverage and a durable and robust implementation. We can apply Jest, a testing framework for typescript, to realize this.

To implement the test plan on an ongoing basis, first, in terms of the test content, for functional tests, I will perform unit testing on each component, such as making sure a react <h1> component will present a value in the MM/DD/YYYY date format. I will also perform component tests, such as whether a button can be clicked and return the result I want or whether an h4 can be re-rendered when we change its internal value. Another important test is the API test; because my project involves making API calls to the GitHub API endpoint, I'll set up tests to ensure that the correct requests are sent to the endpoint and the correct results are returned. I will incorporate the Jest testing library to realize this test plan and adopt the test-driven development (TDD) methodology, first write the test requirements for the front-end, then write the code for the front-end, and achieve a final test coverage of 99%+. 

2. Realize scalability, usability, and security with Amazon S3:
In addition, the application may lack scalability, usability and security if we only use it on the local host.

Therefore, we can host the application on Amazon S3 (which we have already achieved successfully), thus making it easy to access the application via a URL and also apply the security measures available on Amazon web services so that our application is secure during the API call and throughout the entire product operation. In addition, we can also use the S3 bucket in conjunction with Amazon CloudFront (a content delivery network) to help distribute the website globally and achieve scalability while reducing latency and improving load times. 

3. Performance testing with load and stress tests to enhance performance
In addition to this, our application may experience performance degradation in high-traffic situations, such as a decrease in response time and system crashes.

Therefore, I would like to conduct performance testing to enhance the robustness of my application. For example, I would perform load testing to see how my website performs under expected loads, such as response times and resource utilization. I can also use AWS tools and other third-party tools, such as Apache JMeter, to realize the application load testing. I would also like to conduct stress tests, such as using LoadRunner to simulate high-traffic situations to see how much traffic my website can handle at a particular time point and understand my website's limit so as to improve my websiteâ€™s performance. Other performance tests I am considering include scalability testing, which focuses on scale-up and scale-out of the product, and endurance testing, which is about the long-term performance of the product. We can also apply elastic loading balancing and auto-scaling by adding the relevant AWS services to the website, enhancing the performance of the application. 

4. Consideration for tests, alarms, and actions to handle unexpected situations
During the implementation and operation of an application, there will always be some unexpected real-world senario that will cause the website to operate abnormally.

Therefore, we need to think about the considerations for tests, alarms, and actions to handle these situations.

In terms of the considerations for tests, I will first aim to achieve comprehensive coverage of potential failures. Moreover, the maintainability of my test code is also important; I want my tests to be easily updated as the code changes. I will also make sure that the tests are integrated into the continuous integration and delivery pipeline so that tests can automatically be run when codes are committed or pulled, therefore finding and solving problems more quickly. I will take into account real-world situations to simulate different scenarios, such as normal traffic, unusually high traffic, etc., to ensure that the tests can cover real-world situations well. At the same time, I will define key performance metrics, such as response time, error rate, etc., to ensure that the performance of our products can be well measured. 

I will set up alarms for test failures in the CI/CD pipeline and send out alarms when important performance metrics drop. For example, the alarms will be sent out when the test success rate or code coverage drops below 99%; the response times are too long, error rates exceed the limit, or the resource utilization of CPU or memory is overly high.

When we encounter problems, we have a very detailed action plan to solve them quickly. For example, when our product experiences bugs or test failures, we will immediately debug and fix the bugs, and we will do the refactoring and maintenance for the code so that the code won't break easily and the tests can be stable. We apply auto-scaling for our infrastructure so that we can handle changing loads. We will also monitor and document the functional and performance tests. The training of employees is also implemented so that problems we encountered before will not happen again.

5. Prevent code misuse by adding licenses
Finally, because our application replies heavily on code, there may be legal and security concerns if others misuse our code.

Therefore, in order to prevent these disputes, we plan to add the appropriate licenses to product the legal rights of the code. We have added the MIT license to this github repository for protection and preventing misuse of our code.
