# 1. Info story or who is the user and why is it important to them
## Who is the user:
The users of this product are recruiters looking for ideal employees in tech. 

## Why is it important to them:
The tech recruiters need to find the ideal candidates with the right programming skills quickly. However, they find that if they look at a candidate's GitHub profile directly, it's difficult to quickly draw analytical insights and quickly understand the skill level of the candidate. Moreover, if they look for a candidate who specializes in certain programming areas, such as Rust, it is very difficult to get the relevant information by only browsing the candidate's GitHub repo. It is very important for recruiters to find the right candidates within a limited time, so that they can deliver results and help to grow the company. 

Therefore, information that can help them quickly analyze a candidate's GitHub account, provide details about their programming skills, and discover the ideal candidate they need is very important to them and can help them achieve their goals and solve their problems. This is also the purpose and motivation of the new information structure, helping the recruiters find the right candidates quickly and effectively.

Therefore, I hope to design an information product where recruiters can enter the candidates' GitHub account name and directly access the account's analysis, helping the recruiter make recruiting decisions quickly.

## The requirements of the informations structure:
To fulfill the requirements from the recruiters to have an information structure that can help them get insights on the candidate's programming skills quickly and effectively, I designed an information structure that should follow the following guidelines.

The new information structure should include:
1. Filtered user general information
2. New insights on the user (active level, time on GitHub, etc)
3. Repository insights (most frequently used language, average stars per repo, etc)
4. Filtered repository information
These information should be in JSON format and downloadable for the users/recruiters

The features of the structure and the portability can be shown in the example structure below:
``````
