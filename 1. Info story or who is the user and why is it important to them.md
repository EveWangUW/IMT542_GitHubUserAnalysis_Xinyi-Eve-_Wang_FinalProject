# 1. Info story or who is the user and why is it important to them
## Who is the user:
The users of this product are recruiters looking for ideal employees in tech. 

## Why is it important to them:
However, they find that if they look at a candidate's GitHub profile directly, it's difficult to quickly draw analytical insights and quickly understand the skill level of the programmer. If they are looking for a programmer who specializes in certain programming areas, such as Rust, it is very difficult to summarize the programmer's skill level and get the relevant information by browsing the programmer's repo.
Moreover, it is very important for recruiters to find the right candidates within a limited time, so that they can deliver results for their company and achieve success in performance and better development of the company.

Therefore, information that can help them quickly analyze a candidate's GitHub account, provide details about their programming skills, and discover the ideal candidate they need is very important to them and can help them achieve their goals and solve their problems. This is also the purpose and motivation of the information.

Therefore, I hope to design an information product where recruiters can enter the candidates' GitHub account name and directly access the account's analysis, helping the recruiter make recruiting decisions for the candidate.
